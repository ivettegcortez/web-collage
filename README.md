# Remix Project!
This is a remix to Theresa Lin's HTML and CSS project.  
_**The original project made by Theresa can be found by going to her github and seeing her repository [here!](https://github.com/theresa-546/web-collage
)**_

_From what I got from the original project was that it was a chill vibe from the city of Tokyo._
_I wanted to remix it so that I could keep the same kind of chill vibe with a different look._

Some changes I made were:
 > - Sizing the animation shape differently and adding more of them.  
 > - Changing the white rose in the right corner become a red one in the top left and right bottom corners.  
 > - Adding a touch of falling leaves and snow to give it a more relaxing vibe.  
 > - Putting dancing ballerina in the middle of the path to show how she matches the ambiance and provides this calming feeling.  
 > - Changing the music to pump up the calmity and get a new tune in.  
 
_I kept the elements she used as the tokyo background, the rain window gif in the background, the flower representation, but I added more to create a different imagery but same feeling._
